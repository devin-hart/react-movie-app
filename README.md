# React Movie App
*creative name!*

A recreation of a different React Movie App using the TMDB.org API. Similar styling and set up, **entirely different code.** 

This current version of the app is a boilerplate for a larger project I have in mind.

## Setup

* Clone or download repository.

* Open directory in your bash/terminal and run `npm install`.

* In `src/App.js` replace the value of the `const API_KEY = ` with your TMDB.org API key.

* In your bash/terminal run `npm start`.

* If it doesn't start automatically goto `localhost:3000` in your browser.

* Start searching for movies.

## Future Updates
* Possibly use a different API and take the app in a different direction.

* Complete redesign.

* Implement SASS.

* Add a database to save lists of movies.
