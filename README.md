# React Movie App
*creative name!*

A clone of a different React Movie App using the TMDB.org API. Similar styling and set up **entirely different code.** 

This current version of the app is a boilerplate for a larger project I have in mind.

## Future Updates
* Possibly use a different API and take the app in a different direction.

* Complete redesign.

* Implement SASS.

* Add a database to save lists of movies.
